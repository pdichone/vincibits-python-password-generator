## Password Generator

A simple password generator script with Python.

## How to Use This Script
1. Run the script. 
2. You'll be prompted to enter the desired length of the password.
3. Enter the length (minimum 4 characters) and press Enter.
The script will display a randomly generated password of the specified length.

# Script Explanation

* The `generate_password` function creates a strong password by ensuring it contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
* The rest of the password is filled with a random selection of characters, and then the whole password is shuffled to remove any predictable patterns.
* The `main` function handles user input and displays the generated password or an error message if the input is invalid.

This script is a basic implementation of a password generator. It can be extended or modified to meet more specific requirements, such as excluding similar-looking characters or adding more complex password policies.
